# What's New in Town

## Project Overview

**What's New in Town** is an innovative platform designed to help users discover newly opened places in their cities. We all experience the monotony of visiting the same places repeatedly, and this project was created to break that cycle. With this website, you can explore exciting new spots in your city and keep your outings fresh and fun.

## Features

The website focuses on four major cities:  
- **Indore**
- **Mumbai**
- **Delhi**
- **Bengaluru**

Users can select their city and browse newly opened places based on specific categories. The categories available are:

- **Fine Dine**: Discover newly opened fine dining restaurants in your city.
- **Restro Bar**: Explore new restro bars and nightlife spots for a fun evening out.
- **Arcades**: Find newly opened arcades for a gaming experience with friends and family.
- **Bowling**: Check out new bowling alleys in your city for a fun night out.

## How It Works

1. **Select Your City**: Choose from Indore, Mumbai, Delhi, or Bengaluru.
2. **Choose a Category**: Pick the type of place you're looking for—whether it's fine dining, a restro bar, an arcade, or a bowling alley.
3. **Discover New Places**: Get a list of newly opened places in your city that match your selected category.

## Why Choose This Website?
