- All restaurant **reviews are collected from Zomato**
- Restaurant metadata is sourced from **Zomato Collections**
- Only **real customer feedback and ratings** are used
- No manual bias or hardcoded rankings

---

## 🧠 Recommendation Engine – Technical Overview

The recommendation system is built using the **Sentence Transformers library** to perform semantic similarity matching between user queries and customer reviews.

### 🔄 Workflow

#### 1. Review Cleaning & Preprocessing
- All Zomato-sourced reviews are cleaned and normalized
- Noise such as emojis, special characters, extra spaces, and irrelevant tokens is removed
- Clean text ensures better embedding quality

#### 2. Sentence Embedding Generation
- Cleaned reviews are converted into **vector embeddings** using a Sentence Transformer model
- These embeddings capture **semantic meaning**, not just keywords
- All review embeddings are stored in a database for fast retrieval

#### 3. User Query Processing
- The user enters a search query (e.g., *best newly opened restro bar in Mumbai*)
- The query is converted into an embedding using the same transformer model

#### 4. Semantic Similarity Matching
- The query embedding is compared with stored review embeddings
- **Cosine similarity** is used to measure relevance
- Reviews with the highest similarity scores are identified

#### 5. Recommendation Generation
- Restaurants with the most relevant reviews are ranked
- The system returns the **Top 3 best-matched places**
- Each recommendation includes a **percentage confidence score** representing match accuracy

This approach enables **context-aware, accurate, and trustworthy recommendations** based on real customer experiences.
